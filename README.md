# ðŸ“‡ Contact Management Application

This is a **React-based Contact Management Application** that allows users to efficiently manage their contacts. The app provides an interactive user interface where users can add, delete, search, and filter contacts in real-time.

## Features

- **Add Contacts**: Users can easily add new contacts by providing details like first name, last name, email, and contact number.
- **Contact Cards**: Each contact is displayed as an individual card, showing relevant information.
- **Search Functionality**: A dynamic search bar allows users to search contacts by their first name, last name, or any other detail in real-time.
- **Delete Contacts**: Contacts can be deleted from the list with a single click.
- **Filter Contacts**: The list of contacts is automatically filtered based on the search query entered by the user.

## How It Works

1. **Adding a Contact**: The form allows users to input necessary details (first name, last name, email, and contact number). Upon submission, the contact is added to the list.
2. **Displaying Contacts**: Contacts are displayed as cards. If no contacts are available, a message will be shown to the user.
3. **Searching and Filtering**: The search box filters the displayed contacts based on the input query, providing real-time feedback.
4. **Deleting a Contact**: Each contact card has a delete button that removes the respective contact from the list.
